Built with: Next.js 16 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
````

Note: The Stack Signature in the template above is shown as the canonical example, but it is **optional**. Per STD-DOC-002 §8 (v2.3.2+), the Stack Signature applies only to the root README of **application repositories** (a repo that ships runnable code — e.g. a Next.js app, a library, a CLI tool). It is **forbidden** in governance documents (standards, rules, skills, templates, orchestrator/meta-repos). The scope test: "Does this repo ship a runnable application whose stack a reader would care about?" If no, omit the footer.

Format: `Built with: <project technologies>` — components separated by `+`, count is project-specific (see STD-DOC-002 v2.3.2 §8).

## 3. Checklist

Before submitting, verify:

- [ ] No emoji in title or sections
- [ ] No ASCII arrows as list markers (use `-` for unordered lists)
- [ ] No em dash in headings or code (use hyphen `-`)
- [ ] No pseudo-graphics for tree structures
- [ ] All mandatory sections included
- [ ] Agent Rules section present if AGENT_RULES.md exists
- [ ] Code blocks have language specified
- [ ] Badges added (optional but recommended for public repos)
- [ ] Stack Signature present at end (application READMEs only — skip for governance docs per STD-DOC-002 §8)

## 4. Example Compliance

### Correct

```text
## Features
- Fast build - uses Turbopack
- Type safe — full TypeScript
```

Note: hyphen `-` is used as a separator in technical descriptions. Em dash `—` is allowed in plain text within list items per MARKDOWN_STANDARD, but prohibited in headings and code blocks.

### Incorrect

```text
## Features
- Fast build -> uses Turbopack
## Features — Core
```

Note: `->` as a separator in list items violates the list marker rule. Em dash `—` in a heading is prohibited.

## 5. Cross-References

| Standard | Relationship |
|----------|-------------|
| STD-DOC-002 | Markdown Standard: formatting rules for README content |
| STD-DOC-003 | No-Unicode Policy: character rules for README content (no emoji, no Unicode icons) |
| STD-ARCH-001 | Implementation Order: README assembly is Step 6 of the implementation sequence |

## 5A. Known Issues and Proposed Solutions

This section documents discovered inconsistencies, missing content, and proposed corrections. Each issue has an ID, status, and proposed action. Issues resolved in the current version are marked `[RESOLVED]`; outstanding issues are marked `[OPEN]`.

### RMT-001 `[RESOLVED in v2.2]` — Stale reference to MARKDOWN_STANDARD v2.1

**Problem:** Prior to v2.2, the note under §2 (Template) cited "MARKDOWN_STANDARD v2.1, section 7" for the Stack Signature format. The actual version of STD-DOC-002 is v2.3, and the Stack Signature is defined in §8 (not §7) of that version. The citation was both stale (wrong version) and misnumbered (wrong section).

**Resolution:** Updated the note to cite "MARKDOWN_STANDARD v2.3, section 8". This matches the actual current version and the correct section number for Stack Signature in STD-DOC-002.

### RMT-002 `[OPEN]` — `AGENT_RULES.md` is referenced but never defined

**Problem:** §1 (Mandatory Sections) row 11 says "Agent Rules | Conditional | Required if `AGENT_RULES.md` exists in project root". §2 (Template) includes an "Agent Rules (Mandatory)" section that says "Any AI agent working on this project MUST read and follow `AGENT_RULES.md`". §3 (Checklist) includes "Agent Rules section present if AGENT_RULES.md exists". However, no standard in the project defines:
- What `AGENT_RULES.md` is
- What its mandatory structure is
- Who creates it
- What its relationship is to the standards set (Group B) and the worklog system (Group A per STD-ARCH-001)

The file is referenced as if it were a well-known artifact, but it has no governing standard.

**Proposed solution:** One of:
1. Create a new standard `STD-DOC-006` (Agent Rules Standard) that defines `AGENT_RULES.md` — its structure, mandatory sections, relationship to AGENT_RULES template, and creation process. This is the cleanest option but adds a new standard.
2. Define `AGENT_RULES.md` as a section within an existing standard. The most natural home is `STD-AGENT-001` (Subagent Standard) or `STD-ENV-002` (Z.ai Integration) — both already discuss agent rules in passing.
3. Remove the `AGENT_RULES.md` reference from this template and replace with an inline "Agent Rules" section in the README itself (no external file). This is the lightest option.

Recommended: option 2, with `STD-ENV-002` as the host (since AGENT_RULES.md was originally extracted from there per its Version History v1.0 entry).

### RMT-003 `[OPEN]` — §1 table numbering vs §2 template structure mismatch

**Problem:** §1 (Mandatory Sections) lists 12 sections in numbered order. §2 (Template) does not preserve this numbering — it omits numbers and presents sections in a slightly different order. Specifically:
- §1 lists Stack Signature as #12 (last).
- §2 template places Stack Signature at the end of the file (correct), but does not number it.
- §1 lists Agent Rules as #11.
- §2 template places Agent Rules before the Stack Signature (correct relative order), but does not number it.
- §2 template includes "Project Structure" and "Scripts" sections that §1 also lists, but the template's order does not strictly follow §1's numeric order (e.g., Configuration appears after Scripts in the template, but is #6 in §1 before Scripts at #9).

This makes it hard to verify that the template satisfies the §1 requirements by direct comparison.

**Proposed solution:** Add the section number from §1 as a comment at the start of each section in the §2 template, e.g., `<!-- Section 6: Configuration -->`. This preserves readability while making the §1 ↔ §2 mapping verifiable. Alternatively, restructure §2 to follow §1's order strictly.

### RMT-004 `[RESOLVED in v2.3]` — Stack Signature format rule contradicts STD-DOC-002

**Problem:** §2 note said "Format: `Built with: <Framework> + <Language> + <Styling>`". STD-DOC-002 §8 said "Format: `Built with: <project technologies>`" and adds "Content: letters, digits, `+` and `:` signs". The README_TEMPLATE format string `<Framework> + <Language> + <Styling>` implies exactly three components separated by `+`. STD-DOC-002 allows any number of components (e.g., "Next.js 16 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Prisma"). The README_TEMPLATE's three-component form is more restrictive than STD-DOC-002.

**Resolution (v2.3):** Resolved by scoping, not by reformatting. STD-DOC-002 §8 was clarified in v2.3.2: Stack Signature applies ONLY to application repository README/CHANGELOG, NOT to governance documents (standards, rules, skills, templates, orchestrator meta-repos). The format contradiction is now moot — the rule itself is scoped out for governance docs (including this template file). The template's §2 note now reads: "Format: `Built with: <project technologies>` — components separated by `+`, count is project-specific (see STD-DOC-002 v2.3.2 §8)." The 3-component restriction is removed. The trailing `Built with:` footer that this template file itself had (treating it as if it were an application README) was removed in the same project-wide cleanup (worklog task stack-signature-cleanup-2026-06-18).

| 2.3 | 2026-06 | Stack Signature scope cleanup (worklog task stack-signature-cleanup-2026-06-18): §1 row #12 changed Required Yes -> Optional with scope note (applies to application READMEs only, not governance docs). §2 note rewritten to remove 3-component format restriction (was contradicting STD-DOC-002 §8). §3 checklist item qualified with scope. RMT-004 RESOLVED by scoping. Removed cargo-cult `Built with:` footer from this template file itself (it is a governance doc per new §8 scope). |
